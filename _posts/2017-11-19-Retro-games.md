Pac man

* The different sprites in Pac man were: the 4 ghosts, Pac man(who is you) and the cherry.

* The variables were that you can move : left, right, up and down with Pac man and the ghosts but the cherry stays in 1 position.

* The aim of the game is to get the most points. Collect all the chips without touching any of the ghosts. You have 3 lives and there are special power-ups that can let you kill the ghosts. The cherry spawns, a bit after you have taken it.The chips, cherry and the ghosts give you points.

Space invaders

* The different sprites in  space invaders were: The aliens, the gun(who is you)and the 4 shields.

* The different variables were that you can move: just left and right as the gun, the aliens can move left, right and down but the shields stay in 1 position.

* The aim of the game is to get the most points. Shoot the aliens to earn points, there is a special alien that goes across the top of the screen and gives you lots of points if you shoot it. The aliens can shoot your shields and each shot destroys a bit of it. You aswell can hit and destroy some of your shield.

Donkey Kong

* The different sprites in Donkey kong were: Mario(who is you), Donkey Kong, Peach, the ladders, the barrels, the fire spirits and the planks.

* The different variables were that you can move: left, right, up and down as Mario,  The barrels can go left, right and down and the fire spirits can move left and right. Everyone and everything else stays in 1 position.

* The aim of the game is to get to the top of the tower(which saves Peach) and get the most points.The barrels can go along the planks but sometimes they go down the ladders which makes the game a lot harder. There is also a special barrel that goes straight down If you touch the barrels it's game over.You, can only go up by the ladders.

Asteroids

* The different sprites in Asteroids were: The spaceship(which is you), the boulders, the big UFO's and the small UFO’s.

* The different variables were that you can move: anywhere you want as the spaceship, randomly as the boulder and the UFO's go randomly aswell.

* The aim of the game is to get the most points. The spaceship has to move move around and shoot the boulders to stay alive but the when the big boulder is shot, it goes into 2 smaller boulders, then 4 smaller boulders. There are also UFO's that do the same as the spaceship but they are trying to kill you. The big and small UFO do the same thing.

Curveball

* The different sprites were: the ball and the 2 shields(1 of which is you(blue)).

* The different variables were that you can move: anywhere you want as the blue shield, anywhere as the red shield, wherever you put the shield as the ball.

* The aim of the game is to try and make your opponent not hit the ball with his shield, if this happens then 1 of your opponent's points will be deducted. In the first level you start of with 5 lives, your opponent starts with 3. But every round that you progress your opponent goes back to 3 points when you stay on how many you had on the previous round. To play you need to touch the ball with your shield, it’s a bit like tennis but with shields not rackets. All of this is going on in a box so you make the ball hit the walls to make it harder for your opponent.

I promise none of this is copied and pasted.
